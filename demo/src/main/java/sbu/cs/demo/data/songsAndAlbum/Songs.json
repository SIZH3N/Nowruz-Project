    "lyrics": "I walked through the door with you, the air was cold\nBut somethin\u0027 \u0027bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister\u0027s house\nAnd you\u0027ve still got it in your drawer, even now\n\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe\u0027re singin\u0027 in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin\u0027 down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\nAnd I know it\u0027s long gone and\nThat magic\u0027s not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I\u0027m not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\u0027Causе there we arе again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red \u0027cause you were lookin\u0027 over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin\u0027 red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother\u0027s tellin\u0027 stories \u0027bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me \u0027bout your past, thinkin\u0027 your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin\u0027 town\nAnd I was thinkin\u0027 on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe\u0027s gonna say it\u0027s love,\" you never called it what it was\n\u0027Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin\u0027 it\u0027s the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\nAnd I know it\u0027s long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n\u0027Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe\u0027re dancin\u0027 \u0027round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we\u0027d swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece \u0027til you tore it all up\nRunnin\u0027 scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein\u0027 honest\nI\u0027m a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin\u0027 here\n\u0027Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\nThey say all\u0027s well that ends well, but I\u0027m in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would\u0027ve been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin\u0027 in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin\u0027 me what happened, you\nThat\u0027s what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin\u0027 coffee like you\u0027re on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin\u0027 you to come\nAnd he said, \"It\u0027s supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\nTime won\u0027t fly, it\u0027s like I\u0027m paralyzed by it\nI\u0027d like to be my old self again, but I\u0027m still tryin\u0027 to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n\u0027Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can\u0027t get rid of it\n\u0027Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n\u0027Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you\u0027ve ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at tellin\u0027 jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I\u0027ll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI\u0027m a soldier who\u0027s returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n\u0027Cause in this city\u0027s barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it",

Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n\u0027Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\u0027s pad\nSingin\u0027 to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I\u0027ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin\u0027 at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin\u0027 I\u0027m a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I\u0027m superhuman\nInnovative and I\u0027m made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin\u0027 off of me and it\u0027ll glue to you and\nI\u0027m devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin\u0027 audience a feeling like it\u0027s levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they\u0027ll be celebrating\n\u0027Cause I know the way to get \u0027em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he\u0027s too mainstream.\"\nWell, that\u0027s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It\u0027s not hip-hop, it\u0027s pop,\"—\u0027cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make \u0027em lose it\n\"I don\u0027t know how to make songs like that\nI don\u0027t know what words to use.\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I\u0027m rippin\u0027 any one of these verses that versus you\nIt\u0027s curtains, I\u0027m inadvertently hurtin\u0027 you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself \u0027cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I\u0027m a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues, but it\u0027s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you\nI\u0027m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI\u0027ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin\u0027 Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there\u0027s something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here\u0027s what they want from me\nThey\u0027re askin\u0027 me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life\u0027s handin\u0027 you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can\u0027t batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake \u0027em a cake then?\nDon\u0027t mistake him for Satan\nIt\u0027s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon\u0027t be a retard—be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a god?",
